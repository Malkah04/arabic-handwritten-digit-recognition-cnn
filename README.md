# Arabic Handwritten Digit Recognition Using CNN - CS417 Final Project

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten Arabic digits. The goal is to accurately recognize digits from 0 to 9 in image format, addressing the unique challenges presented by variations in Arabic script. This model is trained to provide a robust solution for automated recognition tasks.

## 📌 Project Overview

Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental computer vision problem. In this project, a CNN model is trained to classify Arabic handwritten digits. CNNs are well-suited for this task because they automatically learn spatial features such as edges, curves, and shapes from images.
